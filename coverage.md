### Statement Coverage:
Statement coverage checks whether each line of code has been executed at least once during testing. It ensures that all statements in the code are run but may not cover every possible logical path or condition.

### Branch Coverage:
Branch coverage ensures that every branch (true/false path) of each control structure (like `if` or `else`) is tested. It guarantees that all possible decision outcomes in the code are executed, offering more thorough testing than statement coverage.

### Predicate Coverage:
Predicate coverage focuses on testing each logical sub-expression within compound conditions, ensuring all possible combinations of conditions are evaluated. It provides more granular testing than branch coverage, especially for complex logical expressions.
